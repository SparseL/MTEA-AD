# 	MTEA-AD

We provided MATLAB implementations for Multitask evolutionary algorithm based on anomaly detection (MTEA-AD).

## Getting started

- Clone this repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:xiaofangxd/MTEA-AD.git
cd MTEA-AD
```

- Install MATLAB.

### Test Suites

We provide two test suites, MTO problems used in the CEC 2017 EMTO competition and MaTO problems with ten tasks. You can get them from the folder problems/ and the file public/Task.m.

### Running

- Running main.m. 
- If you want to modify the algorithm parameters, please visit the file public/PARAMETER.m.
